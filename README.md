Prism File Transfer System
Prism is a file transfer service that you run on one computer (we will call server) so that any device with an internet browser can connect and send or receive files to/from the server. Think of this as a speedier, more private and secure method of transferring your files from device to device.

Rather than using an e-mail, FTP, Dropbox, Google Drive or a USB solution to transfer your files, cut out the middle man! This will increase transmission speed for one as Prism transfers files directly from one device to another.

Another asset is the ability to run Prism on either a dynamic (private) IP or static (public) IP, therefore if your IP address is not made public and static, the file transfers happen locally and don't even get sent to your ISP (or any other middle man). This is becoming increasingly critical in an age where sharing information publicly can be dangerous or incriminating. On the flip side, if you do have a static IP, then Prism can be used to open your hard drive to the internet, so you can share your files across the world if you needed to.
